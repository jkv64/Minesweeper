# Gameplay
For those unfamiliar with Minesweeper, the goal of the game
is to identify all the hidden mines. Left-click a square to
"dig it up": if it's a mine, it explodes and the game is over.
If it's not a mine, it will display a number indicating how many
mines are in the 3x3 square it is the center of. Right-click
a square to mark it as a mine. Try to dig up all non-mine squares
as fast as possible!
